### NOTES

- Everything is run via the @PostConstruct in the broker query service.
- The broker is decided by the @ConditionalOnProperty on the component, eg LadbrokesService.
- The broker in use is set in the application.yml. This can be changed once in the yml to pull data from a different available broker.
- Only Ladbrokes is currently defined.
